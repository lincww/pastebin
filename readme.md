# A simple pastebin

## WHY?

It's quite difficult to find a PasteBin service which fits my requirements well. So why not to write a pastebin by myself? That will be helpful!

## requirements

- [x]Share the code with highlights(The most basic requirement!)
- [ ]Share the binary file.
- [x]Directly get the raw content(With or without a passcode)
- [ ]Delete the file after any time or any visits.
- [ ]Costume the args.

**SOMETHING HIGH LEVEL**

- [ ]User system and logins.
- [ ]Users can modify what they pushed or others shared and leave a commit. And the modify history.
